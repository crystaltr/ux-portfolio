            <p><b>Hi there!</b> < br/>< br/>
                I’m Crystal and I’m currently a UX designer at an Insurance company. I excel mainly in UX, however I have a growing interesting in UI and DesignOps. I’m currently working on growing my UI skills to become an all rounder designer to create meaningful actions for users. < br/>< br/>
                Before discovering UX design I was initially going to pursue being a front-end developer! Luckily I found out UX is a lot more fun and I wouldn’t have to face anymore syntax and bugs...< br/>< br/>
                My portfolio will probably be my last programming project so hopefully there isn’t too many bugs hiding!< br/>< br/>
                Thank you for dropping by •ᴗ•</p></div>
